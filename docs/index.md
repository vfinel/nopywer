[nopywer](https://github.com/vfinel/nopywer/) is a python package that integrates with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) to design 3-phases, islanded power grids using automatic grid design features and analysis tools. 

Nopywer key features include:
- Design power grids using graph optimization algorithms.
- Analyze current flow and voltage drop to ensure safe grid operation.
- Verify material availability against inventory to plan construction.
- Integrate with QGIS for bidirectional synchronization with maps.

Nopywer has been successfully used to design several power grids, as illustred by the following figure.

*Example of a real-case scenario: on this map, houses represent power loads at specific geographic coordinates; their sizes scale with their power needs. In this case, two 3-phases islanded grids were designed to provide power to 61 loads (totalling 195kW) from two generators.*

This site will soon be populated with examples and tutorials about how to design power grids yourself, stayed tuned! 

Oh, and this is an open source projet: contributions are more than welcome :)
