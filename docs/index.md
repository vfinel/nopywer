This page is the documentation of https://github.com/vfinel/nopywer/

It will be soon populated with examples and tutorials about how to use nopywer to design 3-phases, islanded power grids, use autmatic grid design features, control current flowing into each branch of the grid, and computing voltage drop at each node. 

Stayed tuned ! 

Oh, this is an open source projet: contributions are most than welcome !
