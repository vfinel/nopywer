[nopywer](https://github.com/vfinel/nopywer/) is a python package that works with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) to design 3-phases, islanded power grids using automatic grid design features and analysis tools. Use optimization algorithms to design your grid, then control current flowing into each branch of the grid and compute voltage drop at each node to ensure a safe operation of the grid. 

Nopywer has been successfully used to design several power grids, as illustred by the following figure.

*Example of a real-case scenario. Houses represent power loads at specific geographic coordinate; their size scales with their power need. Two 3-phases islanded grids provide power to 61 loads (totalling 195kW) from two generators.*

This site will soon be populated with examples and tutorials about how to design power grids yourself, stayed tuned ! 

Oh, and this is an open source projet: contributions are most than welcome :)
